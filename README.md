    - On Linux/macOS:
      ```bash
      source venv/bin/activate
      ```

3. **Install Python dependencies**:
    Make sure you have a `requirements.txt` file in your project directory. If not, you can generate it with:
    ```bash
    pip freeze > requirements.txt
    ```
    Then install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *Typical dependencies include `Flask`, `aiohttp`, `requests`, `pycryptodome`, `cachetools`, `python-dotenv`.*

4. **Go to the config folder**:
    ```bash
    cd config
    ```

5. **Add your configuration JSON files**:
    Inside the `config` folder, create the following files with your guest accounts:
    - `ind_config.json`
    - `br_config.json`
    - `europe_config.json`

6. **Run the Flask app**:
